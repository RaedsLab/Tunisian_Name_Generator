# Tunisian_Name_Generator
Random Tounsi Name Generator


This is a work in progress API that will generate fake Tunisian identities.

This can be usefull in many ways.. 

(Around 81000000 combinations can be generated)

One GET method is available: 

*   Get a random name [lab.raed.it/php/tounsi/random/](https://lab.raed.it/php/tounsi/random/).*

*   (Get a male or a female name by specifying the gender ?g=M / ?g=F)

This method will return a JSON string with a 'Name', a 'Lastname', a 'Gender' and 'Phone' parameter.

Soon, I'll be adding more possible names, a better gender definition, and a selection method that depends on the provided gender.

--------

Gender value is at best for indication only and you should not count on it yet for your tests.

Feel free to contribute.
