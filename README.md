# Tunisian_Name_Generator
Random Tounsi Name Generator


This is a work in progress API that will generate fake Tunisian identities.

This can be usefull in many ways.. 

(Around 81000000 combinations can be generated.

Two GET methods are available: 

*   Get a random name [lab.raed.tn/tounsi/random/](http://lab.raed.tn/tounsi/random/).*   Get a male or a female name by specifying the gender ?g=M / ?g=F at [http://lab.raed.tn/tounsi/gender](http://lab.raed.tn/tounsi/gender.php).

This method will return a JSON string with a 'Name', a 'Lastname', a 'Gender' and 'Phone' parameter.

Soon, I'll be adding more possible names, a better gender definition, and a selection method that depends on the provided gender.

--------

Gender value is at best for indication only and you should not count on it yet for your tests.

I'll be cleaning the code and putting the project on Github ASAP.
